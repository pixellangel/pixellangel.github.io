			<h2>What is Digital Art?</h2>
			<p>Digital art is a type of visual art, usually illustration, that involves using computers and 
			technology to create a digital file instead of a real-life art piece. Most digital artists use 
			either a drawing tablet attached to a computer or a tablet with a stylus to draw on. However, 
			digital art is possible with just a phone or a computer mouse! It has gained significantly more 
			popularity in recent years with the rise of artist communities on social media.</p>

			<h2>Comparing to Tradition</h2>
			<p>Though digital art is made using technology, it doesn't require any less skill or practice
			than using physical media for traditional art! It's a common misconception that the computer 
			"does the work for you". Digital art does, however, have different tools available than other 
			mediums. For example, art software allows artists to use any available color rather than being 
			restricted by the number of colors they own in their chosen medium. They can also do thngs like
			copy and paste things in their work, select and move specific parts, and transform or liquify
			areas to change their shape. It does take a lot of getting used to, as interacting with the more
			abstract digital medium does not come naturally to most people, even those who spend a lot of
			time drawing or writing on paper. Many artists also prefer the tactile nature of physical media.</p>

			<h2>Joy in Sharing</h2>
			<p>Social media has created a lot of opportunities for artists to form communities and friendships 
			online. Digital art in particular is well-suited for this, as it can be shared online easily 
			without changing much from how the artist intends it to be seen. It also allows for many smaller, 
			niche communities to form around specific artists or groups of artists. Curious about the art
			communities on various socials? Check out the
