			<p>Each social media site has its ups and downs for artists. Here's my ranking of each of the ones I've
			used in the past and present, ranked in three categories: Visibility, or how many people will see your 
			posts outside your follower audience; Community, or the sense of connection with other artists and users
			on the platform; and Audience, or the quality of the interactions people tend to have with your posts 
			(a poorer Audience score means there will be less people with quality things to say on your posts). 
			Out of all the sites I used, Tumblr had the best overall score, even though the Visibility isn't fantastic.
			I reccommend trying different sites to see what works best for you!</p>
